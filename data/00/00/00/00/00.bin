  |   Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem,    |
  |   SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No        |
  |   regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's     |
  |   just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen      |
  |   enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of          |
  |   slow-motion bullets.                                                  |

  |   With its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something    |
  |   new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT's polished,             |
  |   minimalist visual language helps you focus on what's most             |
  |   important - the fluid gameplay and the cinematic beauty of the        |
  |   fight.                                                                |
